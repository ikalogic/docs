# Power Management Overview

The AT1000 provides advanced power management capabilities, allowing engineers to precisely control and monitor power delivery to their devices under test (DUT). These features include:

* A programmable main power supply, capable of delivering up to 24V with adjustable settings.
* Two USB 3.0 ports, each equipped with an independent power supply that can be power-cycled for controlled testing.
* Accurate current measurement across all power supplies for real-time monitoring of power consumption.
* A high-precision bidirectional current measurement feature available on relay 4, allowing for advanced current analysis.


With these capabilities, the AT1000 ensures reliable power control, making it ideal for automated functional testing, device characterization, and power integrity validation.
