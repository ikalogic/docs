# I/O Operations Overview
AT1000 device has 32 Inputs/outputs (which may be further extended by daisy-chaining multiple devices). Any of those I/Os can be configured as Analog or Digital, independently from the other I/Os. 

:::info Digital I/O, under the hood

It's worth noting that, internally, all signals measured or generated by the AT1000 are in essence analog signals. It's only later - in software - that digital thresholds are applied to deduce the logic level, high or low. This gives a lot of flexibility, as any logic level can be defined regardless of the logic standards.

Similarly, digital outputs are generated as analog signals, giving you full granularity over what you consider to be logic "high" and logic "low".

As you will also see in this section, it's possible to synchronize all the outputs so that they change at once (instead of being sequentially updated, one after the other).
