# AT1000 API Documentation 

The **AT1000** is a test sequencer designed to help engineers quickly set up a functional test sequence for a device or a PCB (printed circuit board) involving:
- Digital and Analog I/Os
- Current measurement
- Programmable Power Supply
- USB, CAN, Ethernet, RS232, and RS485 communication

AT1000 can not only test electronic boards, but can also be used to automate loading of firmware via USB ports and dedicated programming cables.

Each AT1000 device has **32 programmable I/Os**, capable of handling both analog and digital signals within a Â±25V range. Outputs support **0 to 25V** operation (negative voltages cannot be generated). Also, each device has **8 dry contacts** including one dry contact with high precision current measurement. Multiple devices can be **daisy-chained** for expanded I/O capability.

:::tip

This documentation focuses on the JavaScript / Python API and provides step-by-step methodology to setup a functional test sequencer using an AT1000. This is not a detailed datasheet for the AT1000 device.

## Key Features
- 32 Analog / Digital I/Os
- 8 Dry Contacts (including 1 contact equipped with high precision, bidirectional current measurement)
- 1 two-amps, 0 to 24V power supply with precise current measurement
- 2 USB-3 ports with precise current measurement and power ON/OFF (USB power cycling)
- 1 100base-T ethernet port
- Synchronization across multiple devices using `SYNC IN` / `SYNC OUT`
- JavaScript and Python APIs for test automation

## Terminology

The following terminology is used all along this documentation

* DUT: Device Under Test
* Tester : individual AT1000 device
* Rank (Device rank) : When several AT1000 device are daisy-chained, the rank is the device number in the chain (0 being the rank of the master, first slave is 1, and so forth.)
